System Monitor – Embedded Linux (Yocto) Project
Overview

This project implements a custom C++ system monitoring application developed and deployed on the NXP i.MX93 Evaluation Kit (EVK) running a Yocto-based Linux distribution.

The application collects system-level data and logs it into a CSV file. It is configured to run automatically at system boot using a systemd service.

This project demonstrates practical embedded Linux development, target-side compilation, and production-style deployment.
